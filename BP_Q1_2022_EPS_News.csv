2022-05-03T02:22:09-04:00,EDT,"BP reports bumper first-quarter net profit, but posts massive loss on hit from Russia exit","BP on Tuesday reported bumper first-quarter profits and boosted share buybacks, despite posting a massive loss after offloading its nearly-20% stake in Russian-controlled oil company Rosneft.

The oil and gas giant’s first-quarter underlying replacement cost profit, used as a proxy for net profit, jumped to its highest level in more than a decade as it came in at $6.2 billion.

That compared with a profit of $4.1 billion in the fourth quarter and $2.6 billion for the first quarter of 2021. Analysts had expected BP to report first-quarter profit of $4.5 billion, according to Refinitiv.

The oil and gas giant also announced a further $2.5 billion in share buybacks.

However, BP reported a headline loss for the quarter of $20.4 billion. This included non-cash pre-tax charges of $24 billion and $1.5 billion relating to the exit of its Rosneft stake in response to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

“We took the decision to exit Russia within 96 hours of the invasion happening and today you’re seeing the financial implications of that decision,” BP CEO Bernard Looney told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe” on Tuesday.

Looney said trading had a “very good” start to the year and net debt — which fell to $27.5 billion — was reduced for the eighth consecutive quarter.

“All in all, in an underlying sense, a good quarter for the company,” he added.

When asked to provide further details on how the company plans to extricate itself from Russia, Looney replied: “We have been very, very clear. We are announcing our intention to leave the country. We made that decision as I said very, very quickly and like any commercial process that’s ongoing, we wouldn’t comment and I’d rather not comment on that this morning.”

Shares of London-listed BP rose 2% shortly after the opening bell. The firm’s stock price has climbed more than 18% year-to-date.

BP reported a massive upswing in full-year net profit for 2021, its highest in eight years, supported by soaring commodity prices. Global oil demand roared back last year, with gasoline and diesel use surging as consumers resumed travel and business activity recovered amid the coronavirus pandemic.

2022-05-03T02:14:23.405-04:00,EDT,BP Expands Buybacks After ‘Exceptional’ Trading Performance,"BP Plc boosted its share buybacks by $2.5 billion as cash flow surged, offsetting some of the discomfort caused by a $25.5 billion charge linked to its planned exit from Russia.

The company comfortably surpassed analysts’ expectations after an “exceptional” first quarter for its oil and gas trading business. Other commodities traders from Bunge Ltd. to Glencore Plc have also posted stronger profits, aided by the unprecedented volatility caused by the war.

Shares of BP rose 1.9% to 393.8 pence as of 8:04 a.m. in London.

“In a quarter dominated by the tragic events in Ukraine and volatility in energy markets, BP’s focus has been on supplying the reliable energy our customers need,” Chief Executive Officer Bernard Looney said in a statement on Tuesday. “Our decision in February to exit our shareholding in Rosneft resulted in the material non-cash charges.”

The company followed its peers Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp. and TotalEnergies SE, all of which saw their first-quarter net income -- excluding Russia-related writedowns -- soar in tandem with oil and gas prices after the invasion of Ukraine.

BP will expand its share buyback by $2.5 billion, following through on a pledge to return a portion of surplus cash flow to investors. The company repurchased $1.6 billion in the first quarter. That figure could grow further this year as oil and gas prices are forecast to remain above $100.

A Good Year. BP profits of $6.25 billion for 1Q 2022 were more than double a year earlier “Our bullish commodity price deck suggests the company is likely to generate significant free cash flow in the coming years,” RBC analyst Biraj Borkhataria said in a note. “We believe investors could receive more than 50% of the company’s market cap back over the next five years.”

BP’s first-quarter adjusted net income was $6.25 billion, more than double the amount from a year earlier and surpassing analyst expectations of $4.43 billion. The figure doesn’t include an accounting loss of $29.29 billion, which is largely due to BP’s decision to dump its stake of about 20% in Kremlin-controlled oil giant Rosneft PJSC.

The impact of the writedown on BP’s total equity led to a slight increase in gearing to 25.9%, even as net debt fell to $27.46 billion.

BP remained tight-lipped about its strong trading performance. “We don’t disclose the numbers” for the division, Looney said in an interview with Bloomberg TV, while noting the “incredible volatility” in the quarter. The unit that refines and trades oil products posted an almost fivefold increase in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to $2.03 billion.

London-based BP emphasized its commitment to help the U.K. boost its energy security, pledging investments of £18 billion ($23 billion) by the end of 2030, including North Sea oil and gas and also low-carbon sources. BP nevertheless stuck to its strict annual capital expenditure budget of $14 billion to $15 billion, and spent $2.9 billion in the first quarter.

In the first quarter, the total production of 966 thousand barrels of MBoe/d improved from 909 MBoe/d in the year-ago quarter. Key project start-ups primarily contributed to the production.

After calls from Britain's opposition for a windfall tax on energy firms, BP said it would pay up to 1 billion pounds ($1.25 billion) in UK tax in 2022 - much more than the $283 million reported in 2020. It did not give 2021 figures. The government said a new tax would not help the energy transition. read more

The charge does not affect BP's cashflow. Some $14.5 billion of the writedown relates to stakes in Rosneft and two joint ventures, which have now been cut to zero. Another $11.1 billion relates to changes in foreign exchange value.
Although costly, sources told Reuters in March that Looney had long had reservations about how the stake in Rosneft would fit into BP's plans to shift to renewables. read more
