2022-08-02T02:17:56-04:00,EDT,Oil major BP boosts dividend as quarterly profits jump on high commodity prices,"LONDON — U.K. oil giant BP on Tuesday raised its dividend and boosted share buybacks after tripling second-quarter profits on robust refining margins and trading.

The British energy major posted second-quarter underlying replacement cost profit, used as a proxy for net profit, of $8.5 billion.


That compared with a profit of $6.2 billion in the first three months of the year and $2.8 billion for the second quarter of 2021. Analysts had expected BP to report first-quarter profit of $6.3 billion, according to Refinitiv.

BP also announced a 10% increase in its quarterly dividend payout to shareholders, raising it to 6.006 cents per ordinary share.

Shares of BP rose 4% during morning deals in London, trading near the top of the pan-European Stoxx 600
. The stock price is up over 23% year-to-date.

BP’s results once again underscore the stark contrast between Big Oil’s profit bonanza and those grappling with a deepening cost of living crisis.

The world’s largest oil and gas companies have shattered profit records in recent months, following a surge in commodity prices prompted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. For many fossil fuel firms, the immediate priority appears to be returning cash to shareholders via buyback programs.

2022-08-02T15:57:00-04:00,EDT,BP boosts dividend after profit hits 14-year high,"LONDON, Aug 2 (Reuters) - BP's (BP.L), opens new tab second quarter profit soared to $8.45 billion, its highest in 14 years, as strong refining margins and trading prompted it to boost its dividend and spending on new oil and gas production.
The strong performance caps a blowout quarter for the top Western oil and gas companies on the back of soaring energy prices that have increased pressure on governments to impose new taxes on the sector to help consumers.

""The company is running well and it continues to strengthen. We have real strategic momentum,"" Chief Executive Officer Bernard Looney told Reuters.
BP shares were up 4.3% by 1315 GMT, hitting their highest levels since June and strongly outperforming the European energy index (.SXEP), opens new tab which was up 0.7%. BP shares have gained 23% this year but are still some 10% below pre-pandemic levels.
Looney, who took office in 2020 with a vow to rapidly shift BP away from fossil fuels to renewables, said that the company will increase its spending on new oil and gas by $500 million in response to the global supply crunch.

""We will direct more investment towards hydrocarbons to help with energy security in the near term,"" Looney said. ""We'll probably direct about a half a billion dollars for hydrocarbons.""
BP plans to maintain its overall capital expenditure this year in a range of $14 billion to $15 billion.
BP increased its dividend by 10% to 6.006 cents per share, more than its previous guidance of a 4% annual increase. It halved its dividend to 5.25 cents in July 2020 for the first time in a decade in the wake of the pandemic. 

The company also increased its share repurchases plan for the current quarter to $3.5 billion after it bought $4.1 billion in the first half of the year.
""The fact it produced its highest quarterly profit in 14 years, even though oil prices were higher during that period than they are now, suggests BP is a more efficient machine than it was previously,"" AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said.
The company said it expected crude oil and gas prices as well as refining margins to remain ""elevated"" in the third quarter and said it would stick to its target of using 60% of its surplus cash on share buybacks.

The surge in revenue also allowed BP to sharply reduce its debt to $22.8 billion from $27.5 billion at the end of March.
BIG OIL BONANZA

Its underlying replacement cost profit, its definition of net earnings, reached $8.45 billion in the second quarter, the highest since 2008 and far exceeding analysts' expectations of $6.8 billion.
That was up from $6.25 billion in the first quarter and $2.8 billion a year earlier.
The strong performance was driven by strong refining margins, ""exceptional"" oil trading performance as well as higher fuel prices, although gas trading was weaker, BP said.
An outage at a major U.S. Gulf Coast liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant, also weighed on profits.
The Freeport LNG plant supplies BP with 4 million tonnes per year of LNG, out of a total portfolio of 18 million tonnes.
BP is looking at ways to supply customers despite the lost supply though that will come at an elevated cost, Chief Financial Officer Murray Auchincloss told Reuters.

The company has allocated money to cover for the extra costs of LNG supply as a result of the Freeport outage, he said.
Jefferies analysts estimated those extra costs this quarter would total $700 million to $900 million.",2,2022,https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/bp-reports-q2-profit-845-billion-boosts-dividend-2022-08-02/
2022-08-02T15:57:00-04:00,EDT,"bp’s profits jump to 14 year high, hitting nearly £7bn for Q2","bp’s profits have surged to £6.9 billion ($8.45 billion) for Q2 2022, its highest in 14 years, amidst the continued energy crisis.

The oil and gas (O&G) giant’s profit grew in the second quarter of the year from £5.1 billion ($6.2 billion) in Q1. This growth was due to strong refining margins, oil trading performance and higher liquids realisations, it noted.

Gas marketing and trading was down from the “exceptional result” in the first quarter however, impacted by an ongoing outage at Freeport LNG.

bp’s reported profit grew to £7.6 billion ($9.3 billion), up from a loss of £16.7 billion ($20.4 billion) for Q1 2022.

This first quarter loss was driven by the company’s decision to exit its 19.75% shareholding in Rosneft and other businesses with Rosneft in Russia – the company’s board voted on its continued involvement with the Russian state-owned O&G company in February, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, finding the relationship “simply cannot continue” in light of the aggression.

Overall, the company’s profits for the first half of 2022, sat at £11.95 billion ($14.6 billion).

“Today’s results show that bp continues to perform while transforming,” said Bernard Looney, chief executive officer of bp.

“Our people have continued to work hard throughout the quarter helping to solve the energy trilemma – secure, affordable and lower carbon energy. We do this by providing the oil and gas the world needs today – while at the same time, investing to accelerate the energy transition.”

The company pointed to a recent partnership with Iberdrola to develop green hydrogen in the UK, Spain and Portugal, as well as rollout electric vehicle charging infrastructure, as evidence of its continued focus on transforming into an integrated energy company.

bp has a total pipeline of 25.8GW of renewables, 80% of which are solar, driven by its development company Lightsource bp. It has 4.4GW of renewables developed to final investment decision stage globally.

Its operating cash flow for Q2 was £8.9 billion ($10.9 billion), and includes £0.98 billion ($1.2 billion) of payments it is making related to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.

During Q2, bp executed £1.9 billion ($2.3 billion) of share buybacks, and completed the £2 billion ($2.5 billion) programme announced with its first quarter 2022 results on 22 July.

It saw surplus cash flow of £5.4 billion ($6.6 billion) in the second quarter, and intends to execute a $3.5 billion share buyback before announcing its Q3 results. The company has now paid back 60% of surplus cash flow from 2021 and the first-half of 2022 through share buybacks.

For the ninth successive quarter, the company’s net debt fell, to reach £18.7 billion ($22.8 billion) by the end of Q2.

The company’s results follow fellow O&G giant Shell announcing adjusted earnings of £9.6 billion for Q2 last week.

Continued high commodity prices drove their profits, with gas prices in particular remaining high and volatile, impacted by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

On the back of these high prices, energy bills in Britain are predicted to £3,420 and £3,850 for the Q4 22 and Q1 23 period respectively.

2022-08-02T15:57:00-04:00,EDT,BP sees biggest profit in 14 years as energy bills soar,"BP has reported its biggest quarterly profit for 14 years after oil and gas prices soared.

The energy giant saw underlying profits hit $8.45bn (£6.9bn) between April and June - more than triple the amount it made in the same period last year.
It comes as typical household energy bills have been forecast to hit more than £3,600 a year this winter.
The bumper profits have prompted calls for the government to tax firms further to help families with rising bills.
BP's profits were the second highest for the second quarter in the firm's history.

It follows a host of profit announcements from other firms including Shell, Equinor, TotalEnergies and British Gas owner Centrica, which have been reaping the benefits of higher gas and oil prices.

Dale Vince, the founder of energy supplier Ecotricity said BP was ""holding a shedload of money that is coming from hard-pressed bill-payers in our country"", adding he believed it was time to increase taxation on the profits of oil and gas companies.
""Clearly there are exceptional windfall profits in the oil and gas sector, and clearly there's a problem in the energy market, and we should fix one with the other,"" he told the BBC's Today programme.
Campaign groups Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth as well as Labour and the Liberal Democrats also called for a tougher windfall tax on oil and gas firm profits.
Professor Nick Butler, a former vice president of BP, said he believed the energy giant was ""very sensitive to the reputational problems of making money at this level"".

He told the BBC there was a ""real case"" for the government calling together the industry ""to find a plan to get us through the winter"".
""You have Europe as a whole now cutting back gas use by 15% immediately, which is not happening here, and actually going out around the world to secure as much of the supply as they possibly can through the winter,"" he said.
The government has introduced a package of measures to help people with energy bills, such as a £400 discount, and following political pressure, ministers announced in May that oil and gas firms would pay an extra 25% on profits made in the UK.
The tax applies from 26 May to profit made in the UK, which for most oil and gas companies is a small part of their operations. For BP, it accounts for a tenth of overall oil and gas production.
BP will therefore not be required to pay the levy on the majority of the profits it made between April and June.

The Treasury said it did not comment on ""individual taxpayers"", but added it expected the windfall tax, called the Energy Profits Levy, to raise about £5bn in its first year.
Critics of a windfall tax argue it might hit pension funds invested in energy firms.
However, pension funds are invested across different countries and industries, so a tax in one sector is unlikely to make a noticeable difference.
What's driving up profits?
The huge increase in profits for firms has been fuelled by higher prices for oil and gas, which have risen sharply due to the war in Ukraine.
In recent months, Russia has reduced supplies to Europe following the invasion and fears are growing it may switch off the taps altogether.

The potential of gas supply problems has led to the wholesale price soaring, which has led to energy firms passing those costs onto customers - pushing up household energy bills by unprecedented amounts.
Higher oil prices have also led to the price of petrol and diesel reaching record highs at the pumps in recent months, although prices have started to fall slightly.

Dr Craig Lowrey, principal consultant at Cornwall Insight, told the BBC's Today programme that energy bills ""at this point in time"" looked set to stay high across 2023 and into 2024 and warned higher bills was ""a long-term problem for households.""
He said current government help would make a ""dent"" in higher bills but was ""not going to offset this.""

'Cash machine'
BP said its bumper profit results were driven by strong refining margins and oil trading. It announced it would boost shareholder payouts by 10% as well as buy back shares as a result of its higher earnings.
Last year, chief executive Bernard Looney described the energy market as ""a cash machine"".
But on Tuesday he said the company's staff had helped to solve an ""energy trilemma"" which he added was ""secure, affordable and lower carbon energy"".
In a conference call he added: ""In terms of cost of living we all have to recognise that it's a very, very difficult place for people, not just, by the way, in the UK but across of the world right now.
""We understand that, we get it. Our people inside the company get it, they want to help.""

Mr Looney said BP was ""backing Britain"" by investing £18bn in the country this decade.
The company said its half-year figures were affected by a massive £19.9bn hit from its move to ditch the its near-20% stake in Russian oil producer Rosneft in response to the Ukraine war.
Richard Hunter, head of markets at online investment firm Interactive Investor, said BP had ""already made some strong progress"" in recouping the financial pain of its Russian exit, adding BP's latest results were an ""early indication of the company's ability to repair such damage"".

The contrast is stark but inevitable. The same high oil and gas prices emptying the pockets of consumers are filling those of the companies that sell it.
BP's profit from April to June was triple the amount than last year and is the second highest in the company's long history.
The company said it would increase its payments to shareholders by £3.6bn in the next three months. Those shareholders include most pension funds but these numbers sit uncomfortably alongside new estimates that average annual energy bills will cost over £3,600 a year.
Insiders at BP and Shell, which announced record results last week, point out that a couple of years ago, both companies were losing billions and no-one was offering to subsidise their losses.

2022-08-02T02:17:56-04:00,EDT,BP Increases Dividend After Profit Soars to 14-year High,"UK’s oil major BP Plc increased its dividend and share buyback after recording impressive earnings in the second quarter of 2022. The company’s second-quarter underlying replacement-cost profit surged to $8.45 billion, its highest level in 14 years. The strong trading and refining margins prompted the company to increase the dividend and invest in new oil and gas production.

Gains by Overall Industry

BP’s results came after the three biggest western oil and gas corporations, Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., and Shell Plc, reported a record $46 billion in collective profits in the second quarter of 2022. The world’s largest energy companies have plenty of cash as economies recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic and the demand for fuel and natural gas exceeds the supply. The major oil companies used part of the huge profits to reward their shareholders with higher dividends and share buybacks. For the second quarter, BP increased its dividend by 10%, bringing it to 6.006 cents per common share, and announced a buyback of $3.5 billion in shares by the third-quarter results.

The massive increase in profits for companies has been aided by higher prices of oil and gas, which increased sharply due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. In recent months, Russia cut back on supplies to Europe, and there are growing concerns that it could shut off the supplies completely. This worsened the energy crisis, especially in Europe, where countries are scrambling to find new sources of energy to replace the falling gas supplies that were formerly carried by Russian pipelines. Due to the gas supply issues, wholesale prices skyrocketed. As a result, energy companies are forced to pass on these costs to consumers, which led to an unprecedented increase in home energy bills.

Backlash From Consumers

Major oil companies came under political heat in Europe and the US for posting astronomical profits, while customers bear the burden of increasing prices. Environmental activists and labor groups denounced Big Oil’s soaring profits and urged the governments to enact significant policies to reduce the growing energy costs. However, according to oil companies, rising profits from their conventional businesses are helping them to invest in lower-carbon projects as they transition to renewable energy, although those sections of their operations and the profits produced by them remain small.",2,2022,https://www.globaldata.com/data-insights/oil-and-gas/bp-increases-dividend-after-profit-soars-to-14-year-high/
