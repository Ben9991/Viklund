2022-11-01T02:05:47-05:00,EST,BP rakes in quarterly profit of $8.2 billion as oil majors post another round of bumper earnings,"Oil and gas giant BP on Tuesday reported stronger-than-expected third-quarter profit, supported by high commodity prices and robust gas marketing and trading.

The British energy major posted underlying replacement cost profit, used as a proxy for net profit, of $8.2 billion for the three months through to the end of September. That compared with $8.5 billion in the previous quarter and marked a significant increase from a year earlier, when net profit came in at $3.3 billion.


Analysts polled by Refinitiv had expected third-quarter net profit of $6 billion.

BP announced another $2.5 billion in share repurchases and said net debt had been reduced to $22 billion, down from $22.8 billion in the second quarter.

It reported a net loss for the quarter of $2.2 billion, compared with a profit of $9.3 billion in the previous quarter. BP said this third-quarter result included inventory holding losses net of tax of $2.2 billion and a charge for adjusting items net of tax of $8.1 billion.

The world’s largest oil and gas majors have reported bumper earnings in recent months, benefiting from surging commodity prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Combined with BP, oil majors Shell, TotalEnergies, Exxon
 and Chevron have posted third-quarter profits totaling nearly $50 billion.

This has renewed calls for higher taxes on record oil company profits, particularly at a time when surging gas and fuel prices have boosted inflation around the world.

U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday called on oil majors to stop “war profiteering” and threatened to pursue higher taxes if industry giants did not work to cut gas prices.

Oil and gas industry groups have previously condemned calls for a windfall tax, warning it would fail to resolve a sharp upswing in energy prices and could ultimately deter investment.",3,2022,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/01/bp-earnings-q3-2022.html
2022-11-01T07:37:00-05:00,EST,"BP Sees Quarterly Profits Q3 2022, Records Tenth Successive Quarter of Lower Net Debt","BP was able to exceed analysts’ expectations in its Q3 2022 profits due to high commodity prices.

British multinational oil and gas company BP p.l.c. (NYSE: BP) has announced an $8.2 billion profit in Q3 of 2022. While announcing its quarterly financial results, the oil and gas giant revealed stronger-than-expected profits. Analysts had expected the quarterly net profit to come in at $6 billion. Additionally, the company said underlying replacement cost profit, which is used as a proxy for net profit, was $8.2 billion in the period. The Q3 2022 profits represent a huge jump from what BP reported in the same period in 2021. British energy noted that its net profit was $33 billion at the time.

CEO Bernard Looney commented:

”This quarter’s results reflect us continuing to perform while transforming. We remain focused on helping to solve the energy trilemma- secure, affordable and lower carbon energy. We are providing the oil and gas the world needs today – while at the same time – investing to accelerate the energy transition. Our agreement on Archaea Energy is the most recent step in our strategic transformation of bp.”

Meanwhile, BP said its Q2 earnings were driven by strong realized refining margins, continuing exceptional oil trading performance, and higher liquids realizations.”

BP Reports Impressive Q3 2022 Earnings
BP was able to exceed analysts’ expectations in its Q3 2022 profits due to high commodity prices. In addition, broad gas marketing and trading also contributed to the remarkable performance. According to the Q3 earnings report, BP completed shares buybacks of $2.9billion in the three months that ended in September. It added that the $3.5 billion share buyback program announced while reporting its Q2 results was concluded on the 27th of October. The company’s net debt also reduced from $22.8 billion in the second quarter to $22 billion in the last quarter. BP said the net debt reduction in Q3 2022 marks the tenth successive quarter of lower net debt.

However, the oil giant also reported a net loss for the quarter of $2,2 billion. This is in comparison to the $9.3 billion in Q2. Per BP, inventory holding losses net of tax of $2.2 billion is included in the Q2 2022 financial performance report. Inclusive is also the charge for adjusting items net of tax of $8.1 billion.

Besides BP, many other oil majors have released impressive results in Q3 2022 and other quarterly reports. The likes of TotalEnergies, Exxon (NYSE: XOM), Chevron (NYSE: CVX), and Shell all amassed significant profits in Q3, resulting in almost $50 billion. These oil and gas giants mostly benefited from increasing commodity prices after Russia invaded Ukraine.",3,2022,https://www.coinspeaker.com/bp-profits-q3-2022/
2022-11-01T04:49:05.816-05:00,EST,BP Reaps ‘Exceptional’ Gas Trading Result After Price Surge,"BP Plc’s natural gas division racked up an “exceptional” third quarter, with sales more than tripling after prices for the fuel soared in energy-starved Europe.

Adjusted third-quarter profit for the major’s gas and low-carbon energy division umped to $6.24 billion, which is more than the business made in the first nine months of 2021. The result helped BP post its second-highest quarterly profit on record, just as debate grows for more windfall taxes on gas and oil firms to ease the impact of surging energy bills on households and industry.

BP joined other Big Oil companies, all of which have extensive trading divisions, in benefiting from gas prices that more than quadrupled in Europe over the past year as Russia cut supplies amid its war in Ukraine. That triggered a rush to secure alternatives such as liquefied natural gas, buoying trading profits as fuel from lower-priced regions such as the US was sold to Europe at much higher rates.



BP brought 125 cargoes of gas to Europe in the past 12 months, an increase of 60%, Chief Financial Officer Murray Auchincloss said in an interview.


Despite the stellar performance of BP’s gas business, a breakdown of the unit’s figures wasn’t forthcoming. Even after the urging of analysts during Tuesday’s earnings conference call, Auchinloss declined to provide exact details.

So far this year, LNG cargoes are generating margins of more than $100 million each, compared with less than $1 million in 2020, according to consultancy Accenture. The bonanza shows little sign of slowing with tankers queuing off European ports, either in anticipation of higher prices or stuck in bottlenecks as an unusually mild winter delays the heating season.

The oil major boosted natural gas production, and sales in the gas segment more than tripled over a year to $8.05 billion, according to the earnings report.

BP Joins Big Oil Profit Bonanza With Further Share Buybacks

BP expects global gas prices to “remain elevated and volatile” in the fourth quarter as low supply continues to dog Europe, where the outlook is heavily dependent on Russian pipeline flows or other supply disruptions.

GAS TRADING
Chief Executive Bernard Looney is leading BP's pivot away from oil and gas to renewables and low-carbon energy in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The company is aiming for a 40% cut in its oil and gas output by 2030.
Third-quarter underlying replacement cost profit of $8.15 billion, BP's definition of net income, compared with forecasts of $6 billion in an analyst poll compiled by the company.
BP made a profit of $3.3 billion a year earlier and achieved a 14-year high of $8.45 billion in the second quarter of 2022.
Its latest result was helped by ""an exceptional gas marketing and trading result"" as well as higher gas prices, offsetting weaker refining margins and ""average"" oil trading.

2022-11-01T13:12:00-05:00,EST,BP profit jump sparks calls for bigger windfall tax,"The government is facing growing calls to raise more money from the windfall tax on energy firms after oil giant BP reported a huge rise in global profits.

BP made $8.2bn (£7.1bn) between July and September, more than double its profit for the same period last year.
Surging oil and gas prices have led to big gains for energy firms but are also fuelling a rise in the cost of living.
BP expects to pay $800m in UK windfall taxes this year while rival Shell recently said it will pay none.
The windfall tax was introduced by Rishi Sunak in May when he was chancellor. A Treasury spokesperson said the tax was expected to raise £17bn this year and next ""to help fund cost of living support for eight million people"".
But Ed Miliband, shadow climate change secretary, said that BPs' profits were ""damning evidence of the failure of the government to levy a proper windfall tax"".
""Rishi Sunak should be hanging his head in shame that he has left billions of windfall profits in the pockets of oil and gas companies, while the British people face a cost-of-living crisis,"" he said.

Alok Sharma, UK's COP president and the former Business Secretary, tweeted: ""We need to raise more money from a windfall tax on oil and gas companies and actively encourage them to invest in renewables.""
Treasury sources have indicated an extension to the windfall tax is being discussed ahead of the Autumn Statement on 17 November, which will detail plans for tax rises and spending cuts as the government attempts to fill a ""black hole"" in public finances.

That could include increasing the rate oil and energy companies have to pay on extraordinary profits, extending the timeframe it applies for or expanding it to include other firms benefitting from higher oil prices such as electricity generators.

The Treasury has warned that everyone will need to pay more tax ""in the years ahead"".
What is the windfall tax on oil and gas companies?
Treasury warns of tax rises to fill financial hole
Last week, Shell revealed that it had paid no windfall tax in the UK because it had invested millions of pounds here. But it said it expected to start paying the levy next year.
BP expects to pay $2.5bn in tax on its North Sea business this year, which includes the windfall levy.
The company also plans to buy back an additional £2.5bn of its shares. So-called share buybacks help boost a company's share price and are popular with investors.

""Companies like BP are making huge profits and channelling these straight back to already-wealthy shareholders through share buyback schemes,"" said George Dibb, head of the Centre for Economic Justice at the IPPR, the left-leaning think tank.
""Instead of reducing costs for consumers or investing in renewable energy, these fossil fuel giants are prioritising transfers to shareholders.""
'Windfall of war'
Oil and gas prices, which began increasing once Covid restrictions eased, accelerated after Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, resulting in huge profits for energy companies. But they have also exacerbated price rises - or inflation - for consumers which hit 10.1% in September.
All the big oil firms, including Total and Exxon Mobil, have announced bumper profits in the past week. Overnight, oil giant Saudi Aramco said it had made a profit of $42.4bn over just three months due to higher commodity prices.
On Monday, US President Joe Biden urged major US oil firms who are bringing in big profits to stop ""war profiteering"", threatening to hit them with higher taxes if they do not increase production which would help lower prices.

""Their profits are a windfall of war,"" he said.
BP profit
Commenting on whether oil firms should pay more tax, Nick Butler, a former BP executive who is now a visiting professor at King's College London, told the BBC's Today programme: ""They have to balance what they pay in tax, what they invest in the future and what they pay back to shareholders.
""I think the next tax squeeze will come on the electricity retailers who haven't been subjected to it yet,"" he said.
""But if BP has to pay more in tax I think their shareholders will have to pick up part of the pain.""

Higher energy bills
Higher energy prices have fuelled the rise in gas and electricity bills for both households and businesses.
The government is limiting the impact by temporarily capping the cost of gas and electricity, but instead of lasting for two years as originally planned, this scheme will now end in April.
There have been warnings that typical household gas and electric costs could reach more than £4,300 when support is scaled back.
Oil and gas firms operating in the North Sea are taxed differently to other companies and pay a total tax rate of 65%.
Companies have been able to reduce the amount of tax they pay by factoring in losses or increasing investment.

The UK windfall tax includes a measure that allows energy companies to apply for tax savings worth 91p of every £1 invested in fossil fuel extraction in the UK.
Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Sarah Olney said the tax was ""incredibly weak"".
But a Treasury spokesperson said: ""We also want to see the sector reinvest its profits to support the economy, jobs, and our energy security, which is why the more investment a firm makes into the UK, the less tax they will pay.""
BP's worldwide profit for the quarter was much higher than analysts had expected but dipped from the previous three months due to a fall in the wholesale price of oil.
Oil prices hit $128 per barrel in early March as the assault on Ukraine intensified and a number of countries imposed sanctions on Russia and have since fallen back.

But BP said on Tuesday that even if oil prices dropped as far as to $60 per barrel, it could still afford to return billions of dollars to its shareholders.",3,2022,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63468313
