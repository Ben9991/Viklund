Three years after CEO Bernard Looney took the helm with an ambitious plan to pivot BP away from oil and gas towards renewables and low-carbon energy, the company said it will increase annual spending in both sectors by $1 billion with a sharper focus on developing low-carbon biofuels and hydrogen.
But it scaled back plans to cut oil output, now aiming to produce 2 million barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2030, down just 25% from 2019 levels compared with previous plans for a 40% cut.

As a result, BP reduced its ambitions to cut emissions from fuels sold to customers to 20-30% by 2030, from 35-40%. BP still aims to reduce its total emissions to net zero by 2050.
""We need lower carbon energy, but we also need secure energy, and we need affordable energy. And that's what governments and society around the world are asking for,"" Looney told analysts.
While many investors backed Looney's strategy, which he told Reuters ""is working"", BP's shares have significantly underperformed top Western energy companies since the CEO took office, remaining largely flat compared with a 17% gain for Shell and a nearly 80% rise in Exxon shares.

""If the bulk of your investments remain tied to fossil fuels, and you even plan to increase those investments, you cannot claim to be aligned"" with the 2015 U.N. backed goals to battle climate change, Mark van Baal, founder of activist shareholder group Follow This said.
BP's $4.8 billion fourth-quarter underlying replacement cost profit, its definition of net income, narrowly missed a $5 billion company-provided analyst forecast.

The results were impacted by weaker gas trading activity after an ""exceptional"" third quarter, higher refinery maintenance and lower oil and gas prices.
But for the year, BP's $27.6 billion profit exceeded its 2008 record of $26 billion despite a $25 billion writedown of its Russian assets.
That allowed it to boost its dividend by 10% to 6.61 cents per share, after halving it in the wake of the pandemic, and announce plans to repurchase $2.75 billion worth of shares over the next three months after buying $11.7 billion in 2022.

ENERGY TRANSITION
BP reiterated plans to divide its spending to 2030 equally between the oil and gas business and its energy transition businesses, upping the total budget to up to $18 billion from a previously guided upper range of $16 billion.
Transition businesses, such as renewables and electric vehicle charging, account for around 30% of the current budget compared with 3% in 2019.
BP kept it returns outlook for renewables largely unchanged at 6%-8%, without taking into account debt, even though global offshore wind production costs have soared in recent months.
Looney said BP's wind and solar production will focus more on providing renewable power to generate biofuels and low-carbon hydrogen, focusing particularly in the United States where the landmark Inflation Reduction Act offers investment credits and tax cuts.
BP, whose trading operations further boost renewables returns, maintained plans to have 50 gigawatts (GW) of renewable projects under development and 10 GW operating by 2030.
It said it expects returns of upwards of 15% from its bioenergy business and its combined electric vehicle charging and convenience store businesses, while looking for double-digit returns on hydrogen.
It aims to translate this into a core profit from the transition businesses of $10 billion-$12 billion by 2030, out of targeted total group earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of $51 billion-$56 billion.
BP also wants to increase its focus on renewable natural gas having last year acquired U.S. producer Archaea Energy for $4.1 billion, and it has also set a target to produce 0.5 million-0.7 million tonnes a year of low-carbon hydrogen to initially supply its own refineries.
BP, which increased its 2030 oil price forecast by $10 to $70 a barrel, will focus its global oil and gas operations in nine regions, with plans to sharply increase output from its U.S. shale business and in the Gulf of Mexico.",4,2022,https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/bp-profits-soar-record-28-bln-dividend-increased-2023-02-07/
2023-02-07T12:53:00-05:00,EST,BP share price rises as profits hit record high in 2022,"BP’s Q4 earnings miss the mark….
BP said underlying replacement cost profit – its headline measure – in the fourth quarter came in at $4.8 billion. That was up over 18% from last year, although fell short of the $5.1 billion forecast by markets and marked a significant drop from what we saw in the third quarter thanks to softer commodity prices, weaker refining margins and tougher conditions for its gas trading arm.

 

… But BP’s profits hit record high in 2022
Still, the quarter was strong enough to round-off a stellar year for BP, which delivered an annual underlying RC profit of $27.7 billion. That was more than double what we saw in 2021 and blew past the previous record set back in 2008.

BP profits hit a record high in 2022
 

BP raises dividends and buyback
BP has raised its quarterly dividend by 10% to 6.61 cents and launched a new share buyback worth $2.75 billion. That will be welcomed by investors considering some analysts had feared that it would repurchase less than $2.0 billion worth of stock.

The better than anticipated returns came as BP generated much more cash than expected. Operating cashflow came in over $3.8 billion higher than forecast in the fourth quarter, giving BP the firepower needed to spray investors with cash, reduce net debt for the eleventh consecutive quarter to push it to its lowest level in almost a decade, and fund its transition to cleaner energy.

BP remains committed to shareholder returns. Growing the dividend remains high up on its list of priorities and the payout should continue to grow by at least 4% per year so long as oil prices remain above $60 per barrel. Meanwhile, around 60% of surplus cashflow will be used to fund buybacks with the other 40% being used to repay debt, which should see BP repurchase around $4 billion worth of shares each year at that oil price, with more cash on the cards if oil prices remain significantly above that level.

That is important considering BP is trying to close the gap after lagging some of its rivals in terms of returns in recent years. BP has offered investors a total return of 30% since the start of 2022, which is behind the 80% offered by Exxon Mobil and the 44% at Chevron, according to Bloomberg.

 

BP to split investment between clean energy and oil and gas
BP also outlined its latest plans as to how it plans to balance investment and cashflow going forward as it transitions toward cleaner energy projects.

Importantly, BP said 30% of its total investment last year went to transition growth engines such as bioenergy and electric vehicle charging – up from just 3% in 2019.

BP said it plans to invest up to $8 billion into cleaner energy projects between now and 2030 – and that is significant as that sum matches the budget put aside for its core oil and gas business to suggest they are now being treated equally. BP has made big waves in this space, having bought US biogas outfit Archaea Energy and advanced multiple hydrogen projects in the likes of Australia, Abu Dhabi, Egypt, Oman and Mauritania.

However, while investment in cleaner energy is rising, BP has also signalled that it will take longer to transition out of oil and gas. BP said it should be producing around 25% fewer hydrocarbons in 2030 compared to 2019. However, back in 2020, BP said production would be some 40% lower by the end of this decade. That suggests BP believes that both sides are vitally important for its short-term future.

‘It's clearer than ever after the past three years that the world wants and needs energy that is secure and affordable as well as lower carbon - all three together, what's known as the energy trilemma. To tackle that, action is needed to accelerate the transition. And - at the same time - action is needed to make sure that the transition is orderly, so that affordable energy keeps flowing where it's needed today,’ said CEO Bernard Looney.

BP said the accelerated investment into cleaner energy, plus a sharpened focus on oil and gas projects that offer a faster payback, should lead to faster earnings growth. This increased investment should deliver $3 billion worth of incremental earnings (Ebitda) in 2025 with hopes that will rise to $5 billion to $6 billion in 2030.

 

Where next for the BP share price?
BP shares are up over 3% in early trade this morning following the results at 495.35p.

The BP share price is up over 3% after the results
The stock is on the verge of testing the 497.50p level of resistance that we have seen over the past four months. Once this has been recaptured, then it can target the three-year high above 503.0p. On the downside, the stock has only briefly fallen below the 100-day moving average during the past six months so this should provide some support at 471p if the stock comes under renewed pressure.

Notably, we can see that 497.50p ceiling is a firm one when we look at the monthly chart considering this has capped the share price over the last four months.

Can the BP share price breach 497.50p?
A move higher would allow it to target 561p level of resistance we saw for the five months to July 2019.

2023-02-07T02:11:10.629-05:00,EST,"BP Adds to Big Oil Cash Gusher With Dividend Hike, Buybacks","BP Plc hiked its dividend and extended share buybacks after posting a record profit of $27.65 billion for 2022, joining its fellow supermajors by reaping the rewards of soaring oil and natural gas prices.

The cash gusher is delivering significant returns to investors — a 10% increase in the dividend and an extra $2.75 billion of buybacks — while also highlighting a contradiction at the heart of Europe’s oil industry. As major producers talk increasingly about the need to cut emissions and switch to cleaner energy, their polluting fossil fuel business is becoming ever more lucrative as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

BP pledged to accelerate investments in both low-carbon energy and fossil fuels. However, the company slowed down its plan to get out of oil and gas and will be less aggressive in curbing its carbon emissions.

By 2030, production of fossil fuels will be about 25% lower than it was in 2019, excluding the contribution from Russia’s Rosneft PJSC. That’s a big revision to its 2020 goal to cut output by 40% by the end of the decade.


Shares of the company rose 3.2% to 493.5 pence as of 8:01 a.m. in London.

“We are growing our investment into our transition and, at the same time, growing investment into today’s energy system.” Chief Executive Officer Bernard Looney said in a statement on Tuesday. “It’s what governments and customers are asking of companies like us.”

BP said it would evenly split additional investment between low-carbon energy and oil and gas, spending up to $8 billion more on each by 2030. Annual capital expenditure could be slightly higher than previously planned, ranging between $14 billion and $18 billion each year for the rest of the decade.

Record Earnings

The company will target petroleum resources that can be developed quickly, offer a fast payback and overall better returns. Last month, in its Energy Outlook report, BP predicted that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine would accelerate the world’s transition away from fossil fuels as countries seek to boost energy security by generating more renewable energy at home.

BP pledged to deliver higher returns from both clean energy and fossil fuels. By increasing investment and revising oil and gas price assumptions higher, the company said it would grow earnings per share before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by 12% a year through to 2025.

2023-02-07T02:09:03-05:00,EST,BP posts record 2022 earnings to join Big Oil profit bonanza,"Oil major BP on Tuesday reported record annual profits, more than doubling last year’s total as fossil fuel prices soared following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

The British energy giant posted underlying replacement cost profit, used as a proxy for net profit, of $27.7 billion for 2022. That compared with $12.8 billion for the previous year.


Analysts polled by Refinitiv had expected net profit of $27.6 billion for full-year 2022. BP said its previous annual profit record was $26.3 billion in 2008.

For the fourth quarter, BP posted net profit of $4.8 billion, narrowly beating analyst expectations of $4.7 billion.

BP announced a further $2.75 billion share buyback, which it expects to complete prior to announcing its first-quarter 2023 results in early May. It also boosted its dividend by 10% to 6.61 cents per ordinary share.

BP CEO Bernard Looney described the earnings as “a good set of results.”

“First of all, I hope you can see a company that is performing well, performing while transforming. We had our highest operations reliability in our history, we had the lowest production cost in 16 years so the business itself is running very well,” Looney told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe” Tuesday.

“Secondly, we’re leaning into our strategy today. We’re announcing up to $8 billion more investment into the energy transition this decade and up to $8 billion more into oil and gas in support of energy security and energy affordability this decade,” he added. “And thirdly, it’s about making sure we return to our shareholders.”

BP said fourth-quarter net debt was reduced to $21.4 billion, down from $30.6 billion when compared to the same period a year earlier.

Shares of BP rose over 4% during early morning deals in London.

The results see BP join Big Oil’s profit bonanza.

British rival Shell on Thursday posted its highest-ever annual profit of nearly $40 billion. Before that, U.S. oil giant Exxon Mobil reported a $56 billion profit for 2022, marking a historic high for the Western oil industry. Chevron’s 2022 profits came in at a record $36.5 billion.

The West’s largest fossil fuel companies are expected to have raked in combined profits of almost $200 billion for the year, according to Refinitiv data. France’s TotalEnergies is slated to report full-year earnings on Wednesday.

The extraordinary scale of the earnings has renewed criticism of the oil and gas industry and sparked calls for higher taxes.

“People across the country need look no further than their own front door – one of Britain’s own oil companies – which has been making records profit while so many Brits face hardship through no fault of their own,” said Jonathan Noronha-Gant, senior campaigner at advocacy group Global Witness.

“Implementing a windfall tax to aid those struggling financially, paired with a significant increase in renewable energy and home insulation, could be the start of the end to the damaging fossil fuel era, both for people and the planet. BP is richer because you’re poorer,” Noronha-Gant said.

John Moore, senior investment manager at RBC Brewin Dolphin, said BP’s record results underpinned the dividend increase and additional share buybacks.

“It’s fair to say that following the period covered by these results the oil price has weakened, while BP is also emphasising its investment in renewables and its commitment to changing how the company operates,” Moore said.

“But, even allowing for these factors, there will inevitably be a backlash against today’s results in the current climate. They will only add to calls for political intervention at some point in the near future.”

‘Energy trilemma’
In recent quarters, Big Oil executives have sought to defend their rising profits and said the significant disruption to global energy markets due to the war in Ukraine has reaffirmed the importance of solving “the energy trilemma.”

According to a statement to investors from BP’s Looney late last year, this refers to “secure, affordable and lower carbon energy.”

BP, which in 2020 set out its ambition to become a net zero company “by 2050 or sooner,” recently predicted that oil and gas would become a dramatically smaller part of the global energy mix by the middle of the century.

In its latest annual energy outlook, published on Jan. 30, the company said it sees the share of fossil fuels as a primary energy source falling from 80% in 2019 to between 55% and 20% by 2050. The share of renewables in primary energy, meanwhile, was projected to grow from 10% to between 35% and 65% over the same time period.

The wide range of outcomes reflects several possible paths for the energy transition. But in each of BP’s three scenarios, the pace with which renewables enter the global energy system is “quicker than any previous fuel in history,” the report said.",4,2022,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/07/bp-earnings-q4-and-fy-2022.html#:~:text=For%20the%20fourth%20quarter%2C%20BP,2023%20results%20in%20early%20May."
