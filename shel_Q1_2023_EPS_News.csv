2023-05-04T00:08:00-04:00,EDT,Shell Posts Record First-Quarter Profit on Boost From Gas Unit,"Shell Plc posted a record first-quarter profit and maintained the pace of share buybacks as a strong trading performance and higher liquefied natural gas volumes offset lower energy prices.

The company will repurchase a further $4 billion of shares, the same amount as in the prior period. That contrasts with UK peer BP Plc, which saw its share price drop more than 8% earlier this week when it announced a smaller buyback of $1.75 billion.

It’s a difference that could help new Chief Executive Officer Wael Sawan reinforce his message that Shell can stand above the competition by reliably delivering generous cash returns to investors. “Following BP’s cut to the buyback, we received many questions on what Shell would do this quarter given a weaker macro environment,” RBC analyst Biraj Borkhataria said in a note. “What was the fuss about?”

Shell shares rose as much as 3.5% before paring gains to 2,354 pence as of 11:45 a.m. in London. The integrated gas business was a key part of the resilience of Shell’s profit. It posted adjusted earnings of $4.9 billion in the quarter, the second-best performance on record after the prior period. The price of the fuel was down from a year earlier as the energy crisis ebbed in Europe, but the company offset that with higher volumes and lower operating expenses.

Crucial to that segment are Shell’s gas traders. While the company doesn’t break out trading’s contribution to earnings, the company said results were similar to the fourth quarter, when it was a main contributor to record profits for the unit.

“Trading and more importantly optimization in general play a critical role in our business model today for the conventional energy,” Sawan said on a call with reporters. “But I think will play an even bigger role going forward as we look at new energies.”

“Against a lower commodity-price backdrop in the first quarter, Shell’s wide beat with adjusted earnings at $9.65 billion, 20% ahead of consensus, and roughly in line with fourth-quarter levels, is largely a testament to the strength of its industry-leading global gas portfolio.” — Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Industry Analyst Will Hares

Shell’s adjusted net income was $9.65 billion in the first quarter, an increase of 5.7% from $9.13 billion a year earlier. That was well ahead of even the highest analyst estimate and a record level for the first quarter. Net debt dropped to $44.2 billion, down more than $4 billion from a year ago. Production volumes of liquefied natural gas — which has become a key fuel for Europe after Russia cut gas exports — jumped 6% in the quarter with the Prelude facility in Australia returning to operations after maintenance, Shell said. Greater output driving earnings has been a theme this season with Exxon reporting it strongest-ever start to a year after a jump in oil production from new wells.
Shell has scheduled an investor briefing for June when Sawan, who took over the top job at the beginning of the year, will lay out his own strategy. “We would expect any adjustment to the dividend or overall distribution framework to be left for the capital markets day,” said RBC’s Borkhataria.",1,2023
2023-05-04T02:07:00-04:00,EDT," Shell beats expectations with $9.6 billion in first-quarter profit, boosted by fuel trading"," British oil giant Shell on Thursday posted stronger-than-anticipated first-quarter profit, extending a record run of bumper results after commodity prices surged in 2022 following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Shell reported adjusted earnings of $9.6 billion for the first three months of the year, comfortably beating analyst expectations of $8.6 billion, according to Refinitiv. The company posted adjusted earnings of $9.1 billion over the same period a year earlier and $9.8 billion for the final three months of 2022.

Shares of the oil major rose 2.2% during mid-morning deals. Flush with cash, Shell held the rate of its share buyback program steady at $4 billion over the next three months and kept its dividend unchanged at $0.2875 per share.
Shell said its quarterly results reflected improved operational performance and lower costs to run its day-to-day business. It added that robust results from fuel trading and optimization offset the impact of weaker oil and gas prices.

The company reported first-quarter net debt of $44.2 billion, down from $48.5 billion when compared to the same period a year earlier. Reflecting on the first-quarter earnings, CEO Wael Sawan said the company “delivered strong results and robust operational performance, against a backdrop of ongoing volatility, while continuing to provide vital supplies of secure energy.”

Shell’s results follow hot on the heels of U.K. rival BP, which on Tuesday reported a drop in first-quarter profit but beat analyst expectations on robust oil and gas trading. Shares of BP fell on the news, however, as the London-listed company said it planned to slim down its share buybacks.

2023-05-04T05:52:00-04:00,EDT,Shell hands £4.7bn to shareholders as quarterly profits beat forecasts,"Shell has revealed it is handing a further $6bn (£4.7bn) to shareholders after its latest quarterly profits beat its own forecasts.

The oil and gas major reported net profits of $9.6bn (£7.6bn) for the first three months of the year. The figure was slightly down on the sum achieved in the final quarter of 2022 but above the $9.1bn (£7.2bn) achieved in the same period a year earlier.

Its own estimate in advance of the first quarter earnings report had stood at $8bn (£6.3bn).

Shell said the performance reflected a cooling in oil and gas prices since the start of 2023 and higher taxes.

The headwinds, it reported, were partially offset by improved volumes and a better performance from fuel trading and its chemicals and products division.

Its rewards for shareholders - in dividends and share buy-backs - matched the amount handed back in the previous quarter.

Shell said the $4bn buyback programme was due to be completed by the end of the current second quarter.

The dividend of $0.2875 per share was the same as the amount paid for October-December.",1,2023
2023-05-04T07:30:00-04:00,EDT,Shell reports stronger than expected profits ,"Oil and gas giant Shell has reported a stronger than expected profit of $9.6bn (£7.6bn) for the first three months of the year.

The figure was higher than the same period last year despite a slide in energy prices.

Fossil fuel firms have been reaping record profits due to a surge in oil and gas prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year.

However, they have since fallen from the post-invasion peaks.

Shell chief executive Wael Sawan said the company had delivered ""strong results and robust operational performance, against a backdrop of ongoing volatility"". The company also said it would be returning $4bn to shareholders, by buying back some its shares over the next three months.

Despite the fall in oil prices in recent months, Shell said its profits had been boosted by strong trading in its chemicals and refined products business.

Earlier this week, BP had also reported strong earnings for the first three months of the year - although they were lower than in the same period in 2022.
In February, Shell reported profits of $39.9bn for 2022, double the previous year's total and the highest in its 115-year history.

While the jump in oil and gas prices following the start of the war in Ukraine led to big profits for energy companies, it also fuelled a rise in energy bills for households and businesses.

Last year, the UK government introduced a windfall tax on profits made from extracting UK oil and gas - called the Energy Profits Levy (EPL) - to help fund its scheme to lower gas and electricity bills.

Under the government's Energy Price Guarantee, energy bills for a typical household have been limited to £2,500 a year, although this level of support is due to stop at the end of June.

2023-05-04T07:30:00-04:00,EDT, Shell reports first quarter profit of nearly £1.4 billion more than expected,"Shell has made nearly $1.7 billion (£1.4 billion) more in profit than experts had expected in the first three months of the year, the oil giant reported on Thursday.

The company recorded a 5.7% rise in adjusted earnings - more than $9.6 billion (£7.6 billion) - between January and March. Business analysts had expected the firm to perform worse than it did.

Compared with the same quarter in 2022, the company made $9.1 billion (£7.2 billion).

Shell said it had faced unfavourable tax movements at the start of 2023, adding the price it was able to sell oil and gas at had dropped.

BP announces profits of more than £500m higher than expected
However, the firm said that it had managed to offset some of this through cutting operating expenses and a rise in its chemicals and products trading business.

According to Shell, it had decreased production slightly compared to a year ago, to 2.9 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.

Shell also announced plans to buy back shares worth £4 billion (£3.2 billion) from investors over the next three months to return cash to its owners.

On completion, the company will have distributed around $12 billion (£9.6 billion) to its shareholders in the first six months of 2023. Chief executive Wael Sawan said: ""In Q1 Shell delivered strong results and robust operational performance, against a backdrop of ongoing volatility, while continuing to deliver vital supplies of secure energy.

""We will commence a 4 billion dollar share buyback programme for the next three months as part of our commitment to deliver attractive shareholder returns.""

Like its rival BP, Shell's results immediately sparked calls for the government to take a tougher stance against the oil giants.

Labour and Liberal Democrats criticised the announcement, while TUC general secretary Paul Nowak said the government needed to ""end the energy racket"".",1,2023
