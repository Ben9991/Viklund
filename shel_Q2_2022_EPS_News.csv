2022-07-28T08:00:00-04:00,EDT,Shell smashes record again with $11.5 bln profit," Shell (SHEL.L) posted record results on Thursday, with a $11.5 billion second-quarter profit smashing the mark it set only three months ago, lifted by strong gas trading and a tripling of refining profit.
The company also announced a $6 billion share buyback programme for the current quarter but did not raise its dividend of 25 cents per share. It said shareholder returns would remain ""in excess of 30% of cash flow from operating activities"". A rapid recovery in demand after the end of pandemic lockdowns and a surge in energy prices, driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, have boosted profits for energy companies after a two-year slump. Shell bought back $8.5 billion of shares in the first half of 2022 and the new programme is significantly higher than forecast.
""The strong oil price backdrop has helped Shell deliver a blockbuster set of results. The dividend may have remained the same, but the share buyback programme is positive news for shareholders,"" said Stuart Lamont, investment manager at Brewin Dolphin. Shell shares were up 1.6% at 1115 GMT, compared with a 1.3% gain for the broader European energy index. hell said its refinery utilisation would increase to 90-98% in the third quarter, compared with 84% in the second quarter.
Its oil and gas production in the second quarter was down 2% from the previous quarter at 2.9 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd).
Shell's LNG liquefaction volumes stood at 7.66 million tonnes in the second quarter, down from 8 million in the previous three months. Volumes are expected to fall to between 6.9 million and 7.5 million tonnes in the third quarter because of strikes at its Australian Prelude site and planned maintenance.
Shell also said it had received a $165 million dividend payment in April from the Russian Sakhalin-2 oil and gas joint venture that it intends to exit. The surge in cash generation was used to further reduce Shell's debt, which stood at $46.4 billion at the end of June, down from $48.5 billion three months earlier.",2,2022
2022-07-28T08:00:00-04:00,EDT,"Shell Posts Back-to-Back Record Profit, Accelerates Buybacks"," Shell Plc accelerated share buybacks after reporting record profit for a second consecutive quarter due to high oil and gas prices.

The company will repurchase a further $6 billion of shares in the third quarter, having already bought back $8.5 billion of stock in the first half of the year. It’s the latest sign of how Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has delivered a windfall for investors in major energy producers, even as the soaring costs of fuel batters the economy and threatens a cost-of-living crisis.

Almost every major European oil company to report second-quarter earnings so far, from Norway’s Equinor ASA to France’s TotalEnergies SE and Spain’s Repsol SA, has boosted share buybacks as their profits surged. Shell’s second-quarter adjusted net income was $11.47 billion, up from $9.13 billion in the first three months of the year, which at the time was the company’s highest-ever earnings. That exceeded the average analyst estimate of $11.22 billion. The increase in buybacks comes after Shell signaled in May it would increase distributions to investors by more than 30% of cash flow from operations, its previous ceiling for returns. The company maintained its dividend at 25 cents a share. The buyback uplift signals confidence in Shell’s cash flow from operations outlook into 2023,” JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Christyan Malek said in a note. While the lack of a dividend increase could weigh on shares today, the accelerated repurchase program “further enhances the scope for future dividend-per-share upside. Even as Shell returned greater volumes of cash to investors, its debt level continued to drop. The company’s gearing, the ratio of net debt to equity, fell to 19.3% at the end of the second quarter. That’s a stark reversal for a measure that had risen above 30% at the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic.",2,2022
2022-07-28T08:00:00-04:00,EDT,Shell’s Q2 adjusted earnings more than double to $11.5bn,"Shell has reported a more than two-fold increase in second quarter (Q2) adjusted earnings to $11.5bn, from $5.5bn a year ago.

The increase in quarterly adjusted earnings was attributed to strong natural gas trading, higher energy prices, and higher refining profits.For the quarter that ended on 30 June 2022, the company’s income attributable to shareholders surged to $18bn, from $3.4bn in the same period a year ago.

In a press statement, Shell said: “Income attributable to Shell plc shareholders, compared with the first quarter [of] 2022, mainly reflected higher realised prices, higher refining margins, and higher gas and power trading and optimisation results, partly offset by lower LNG trading and optimisation results.”

For Q2 2022, Shell’s adjusted EBITDA increased to $23.1bn, from $19bn in the prior year, benefiting from higher prices.

Cash flow from operating activities for the second quarter was $18.7bn while free cash flow stood at $12.4bn.

Shell’s revenue for the quarter was $103.1bn, a significant increase from $61.76bn in the second quarter of 2021.

The oil and gas firm ended the quarter with a net debt of $46.4bn, down from $65.7bn a year ago.

The company also announced a share buyback programme of $6bn for the current quarter, with plans to complete it by Q3 2022. Shell CEO Ben van Beurden said: “With volatile energy markets and the ongoing need for action to tackle climate change, 2022 continues to present huge challenges for consumers, governments, and companies alike.

“Consequently, we are using our financial strength to invest in secure energy supplies, which the world needs today, taking real, bold steps to cut carbon emissions, and transforming our company for a low-carbon energy future. And, crucially, our Powering Progress strategy is delivering strong results for our shareholders on the back of years of portfolio high grading, combined with robust operational performance.",2,2022
