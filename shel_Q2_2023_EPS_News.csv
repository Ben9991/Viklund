The lower-than-expected profits were a result of lower oil and gas prices, a slump in refining margins, lower volumes, and a fall in LNG trading and optimization results.",2,2023
2023-07-27T06:39:00-04:00,EDT,Shell's profits tumble 56% to $5 billion as energy prices cool," Shell (SHEL.L) on Thursday reported a 56% fall in second-quarter profit to $5 billion as oil and gas prices and refining profit margins fell, prompting the energy giant to slow its share repurchase programme.

The earnings, which missed forecasts, follow bumper earnings in 2022 after energy prices surged in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but were in line with its second-quarter performance two years ago. Shell said it would repurchase $3 billion in shares over the next three months, down from $3.6 billion in the previous three, while raising its dividend to $0.33 per share as previously announced in June.

In June, Shell announced it would buy back at least $5 billion in shares in the second half of the year. On Thursday it said buybacks of at least $2.5 billion will be announced at its third-quarter results. ""We will continue to prioritise share buybacks, given the value that our shares represent,"" Chief Executive Officer Wael Sawan said in a statement.

Shell's adjusted earnings of $5.073 billion missed company-provided analyst forecasts of $5.8 billion.

The results compared with record quarterly earnings of $11.5 billion a year earlier and $9.65 billion in the first quarter of 2023.

In June, Sawan outlined plans to boost shareholder returns and improve performance, including by keeping oil output steady, growing natural gas output and slowing down investments in lower-return renewable energy. ""A fairly disappointing set of 2Q numbers"" due to lower-than-expected earnings from the upstream and chemicals divisions as well as weaker third-quarter guidance, Jefferies analyst Giacomo Romeo wrote in a note. The lower results mainly reflected lower liquefied natural gas (LNG) trading results, lower oil and gas prices, lower refining margins, and lower sales volumes, compared with the previous quarter, Shell said.

Oil and gas prices soared last year in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine but energy prices have dropped sharply this year as fears of shortages have eased.

Benchmark Brent crude prices averaged $80 a barrel in the second quarter of 2023, down from $110 a year earlier.

LNG prices dropped to $11.75 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) from around $33.

Shell, the world's top LNG trader, said earnings from its flagship division halved from the previous quarter due to a weaker performance of its trading division.

Shell reduced its debt pile to $40.3 billion by the end of the second quarter, down from $44.2 billion three months earlier, cutting its debt-to-capital ratio, known as gearing, by one percentage point to 17%.",2,2023
2023-07-27T02:11:00-04:00,EDT,Oil giant Shell posts sharp drop in second-quarter profit on weaker commodity prices," British oil giant Shell on Thursday reported a sharp year-on-year drop in second-quarter profit, citing lower fossil fuel prices and refining margins.

Shell posted adjusted earnings of $5.1 billion for the three-month period through to the end of June, missing analyst expectations of $6 billion, according to estimates collated by Refinitiv.

The company reported adjusted earnings of $11.5 billion during the same period of last year and $9.6 billion for the first three months of 2023.

Shell increased its quarterly dividend by 15% to $0.33 per share, as previously communicated in mid-June. It also announced $3 billion in share buybacks, a program it expects to complete over the next three months.

“At the end of the day, we have a balanced energy transition strategy. What we are looking to do is to be able to do the right things for now and for the future, both for our shareholders and for the planet,” Shell CEO Wael Sawan told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe” on Thursday"".

“We are focused on creating more value with less emissions,” Sawan said. “And what that means is we will continue to pull all the levers to drive further value growth in the organization, while at the same time we will continue to meet our aggressive emissions reduction targets — both for our own emissions, as well as for our customers”.
Shares of the London-listed oil major slipped 2% on Thursday morning.

“The company had previously set the scene with downgrades in its earnings estimates to reflect a more normalised trading environment, but it has still missed expectations with today’s results,” said Stuart Lamont, investment manager at RBC Brewin Dolphin.

“The share buyback programme and increased dividend are good news for shareholders, but will inevitably come with questions attached in the current environment,” he added.",2,2023
2023-07-27T07:32:15-04:00,EDT,Shell Reports Sharply Lower Earnings as Energy Prices Ease," Shell, Europe’s largest energy company, said Thursday that its profit fell 56 percent in the second quarter from record-breaking earnings of a year earlier, to $5.07 billion.

The company blamed several factors for the falloff in adjusted earnings, including lower prices for oil and natural gas. Shell also said earnings in liquefied natural gas, a crucial business for the company, were sharply lower partly because a less turbulent environment meant there were fewer opportunities to profit from trading. Shell’s performance, which came in below analysts’ forecasts, shows that the petroleum industry may have reached a certain equilibrium after an extended period of volatility stemming from the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. If so, large, petroleum-dominated companies like Shell remain very profitable even in a lower price environment.

Shell also continues to reward shareholders. The company raised its dividend 15 percent for the quarter, to about 33 cents a share. Shell also announced $3 billion in share buybacks, a slight decrease from $3.6 billion in the previous quarter. The energy industry has demonstrated resilience in the last few years despite a very volatile environment. Energy companies have compensated for a sharp reduction of natural gas flows from Russia to Europe by bringing supplies from elsewhere, especially the United States. The global oil trade has also so far adjusted fairly smoothly to Western sanctions on Russian crude and refined products.

Those adjustments, along with muted demand growth in China, the world’s largest importer of energy commodities, have allowed prices to ease despite efforts to curb supplies by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. Brent crude, the international benchmark, sold for an average of about $78 a barrel in the second quarter — a 31 percent drop from a year earlier. Natural gas prices in Europe were 65 percent lower.",2,2023
