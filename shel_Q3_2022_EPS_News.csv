2022-10-27T08:00:00-04:00,EDT,"Shell reports drop in profit to $9.45 billion, hikes dividend","  Shell (SHEL.L) on Thursday posted a third-quarter profit of $9.45 billion, slightly below the second quarter's record high, due to weaker refining and gas trading, and said it will sharply boost its dividend by the end of 2022 when its CEO departs.

The British oil and gas giant also extended its share repurchasing programme, announcing plans to buy $4 billion of stock over the next three months after completing $6 billion in purchases in the second quarter. Shell said it intends to increase its dividend by 15% in the fourth quarter, when Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden will step down after nine years at the helm. The dividend will be paid in March 2023.

It will be the fifth time that Shell will have raised its dividend since slashing it by more than 60% in the wake of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. Shell shares were up nearly 6% by 1430 GMT, compared with a 3.5% gain for the broader European energy sector. Van Beurden will be succeeded by Wael Sawan, the current head of Shell's natural gas and low-carbon division.

With a profit of $30.5 billion so far this year, Shell is well on track to exceed its record annual profit of $31 billion in 2008. The strong earnings were likely to intensify calls in Britain and the European Union to impose further windfall taxes on energy companies as governments struggle with soaring gas and power bills. Van Beurden said the energy industry ""should be prepared and accept"" that it will face higher taxes to help struggling parts of society.

Shell's shares have gained more than 40% so far this year, lifted by soaring oil and gas prices in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February and amid tightening global oil and gas supplies.",3,2022
2022-10-27T08:00:00-04:00,EDT," Shell and Total, Oil Giants, Report Huge Profits on High Energy Prices"," Gargantuan profits continue to roll in at Europe’s energy giants. London-based Shell reported adjusted earnings of $9.45 billion for the third quarter, its second-highest profit on record. On the same day, Paris-based TotalEnergies reported a profit of $9.9 billion.For both companies, the profits were more than double what they earned in the same period a year ago.

Shell and Total, like other energy companies this year, are benefiting from high oil and natural gas prices partly stoked by the war in Ukraine, as Russia squeezes gas flows to Europe.

For Shell, the profit was a step down from the record-breaking $11.5 billion it reported for the second quarter, when it received an average of just over $100 a barrel for oil, compared with $93 in the third quarter. Natural gas prices, however, increased in the third quarter. Shell is returning a large chunk of this bounty to shareholders. The company said that it planned to increase its dividend to shareholders for the fourth quarter by 15 percent, to about 29 cents a share. The company also pledged to buy back $4 billion worth of its shares, bringing total buybacks announced this year to $18.5 billion, or 10 percent of the company’s share capital.

Shell’s share price jumped 4.5 percent in trading in London on Thursday.

In what may provoke a political storm in Britain, Shell said it had not yet been obliged to pay the “windfall” tax on oil and gas profits enacted earlier this year by the British government. The tax allows companies to deduct capital expenditures. Shell makes $9.45B in Q3 earnings despite global energy market volatility Email Share Share Tweet Share Article",3,2022

2022-10-27T08:00:00-04:00,EDT, Energy company Shell reports profits of $9.5bn for Q3 of 2022 but not at record levels seen in first half of year," Shell has reported operating profits of $9.5bn (£8.19bn) for the third quarter of this year, lower than that of the three months before but still more than double the same period in 2021. The London-listed energy giant reported two consecutive quarters of record profit in the first half of the year at a time of soaring oil and gas prices. Shares in the company jumped by 4.5% on Thursday morning, and BP shares were up by nearly 3%. The earnings are lower than expected. Shell had been forecast to report net earnings of $10.5bn in the third quarter, compared with net earnings of $11.5bn in the second quarter.

The profits were lower compared with the second quarter because of lower liquefied natural gas (LNG) trading, lower chemicals and refining margins and higher underlying operating expenses.

The total amount paid to shareholders during the three months was $6.8bn. The company paid a dividend of $0.25 for each share held. But Shell wants that amount to increase. Subject to board approval, it intends to increase the amount per share by 15% for the fourth quarter, which would be paid in March next year.

On Thursday the company also said it is to buy back shares worth $4bn from shareholders by the time fourth quarter results are announced, it follows a $6bn round of share buybacks announced in the second quarter results statement.",3,2022
